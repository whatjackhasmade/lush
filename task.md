## About the challenge

This is a challenge, not a test, so feel free to try different approaches to solve it.
What we expect to learn from you with this challenge:

- Your work style.
- How you think and solve problems.
- How you communicate.
- What we expect that you learn from us:
- How we work as a team.
- Have a close look at some of the problems we face daily.

## Considerations

- We won't limit your choice of tools or libraries but make choices that suit your needs. There's no need to
  over-engineer it and the point of the challenge is to evaluate your skills on something small.

## Instructions

Imagine we are building a brand new site which sells products online.

[This is our sandboxed staging GraphQL
playground](https://unicorn-staging.eu.saleor.cloud/graphql/) which you can query and explore to
get product data, as a hint you will need to use the `products` query and `channel` is `"uk"`.

Feel free to create your own project structure.
When you are done, please send us back the source and any other items in a zip file.
Tasks:

- Query the API to retrieve products and list them.
- When clicking in one of the products it should navigate to a view where the user can see more details of
  the product; for example a description or any other useful data you can get from Saleor.
- Preferably we’d love to see it using React and server-side rendering but happy with other solutions as
  long it’s readable and you can explain the context.

- Extra points for creativity
  If you could get this back within a week (it's ok if it takes you a little longer).
